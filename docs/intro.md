# Introduction

Welcome to **Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics**.

This course is designed to guide you through the advanced concepts of robotics, from the fundamentals of ROS 2 to the cutting-edge integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) for cognitive planning.

## Course Structure

The curriculum is divided into four key modules:

### [Module 1: ROS 2 & Humanoids](./physical-ai-humanoid-robotics/module-1-ros2/index.md)
Master the **Robot Operating System 2 (ROS 2)**, the industry standard for robot software. You will learn to create nodes, manage topics and services, and control humanoid robots.

### [Module 2: Digital Twins & Simulation](./physical-ai-humanoid-robotics/module-2-digital-twin/index.md)
Learn to simulate physics and environments using **Gazebo** and **Unity**. We will explore how to create realistic digital twins to train and test your robots safely before deployment.

### [Module 3: Isaac Sim & ROS](./physical-ai-humanoid-robotics/module-3-isaac/index.md)
Dive into NVIDIA's **Isaac Sim**, a photorealistic simulation platform. We will cover navigation (Nav2) and high-fidelity sensor simulation.

### [Module 4: VLA & Cognitive AI](./physical-ai-humanoid-robotics/module-4-vla/index.md)
Explore the frontier of **Physical AI**. We will integrate **Vision-Language-Action (VLA)** models and LLMs like Whisper and GPT-4 to give your humanoid robot the ability to understand natural language and plan complex tasks.

## Capstone Project
Apply everything you've learned in a comprehensive [Capstone Project](./physical-ai-humanoid-robotics/capstone-project/overview.md), where you will build a complete humanoid robot application.

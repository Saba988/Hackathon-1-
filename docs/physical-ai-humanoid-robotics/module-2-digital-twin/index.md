# Module 2: The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity)

## Overview

In the realm of modern robotics, the **Digital Twin** is not merely a luxury; it is a fundamental necessity. A Digital Twin is a high-fidelity virtual replica of a physical system—in our case, a humanoid robot and its operating environment. This module focuses on bridging the gap between theoretical design and physical reality through advanced simulation.

By mastering Digital Twins, you enable a development cycle that is:
*   **Safe:** Test dangerous maneuvers without risking expensive hardware.
*   **Fast:** Train reinforcement learning agents in parallel at faster-than-real-time speeds.
*   **Scalable:** Validate algorithms across countless procedurally generated environments.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:

1.  **Master Physics Simulation:** Configure and tune physics engines (ODE, Bullet) in Gazebo to accurately model mass, inertia, friction, and collision dynamics.
2.  **Simulate Perception:** Implement realistic sensor models for LiDAR, RGB-D cameras, and IMUs, incorporating noise models to mimic real-world imperfection.
3.  **Achieve Visual Fidelity:** Leverage the Unity Game Engine to create photorealistic environments for Human-Robot Interaction (HRI) and synthetic data generation.

## Tools of the Trade

*   **Gazebo:** The standard for ROS-integrated physics simulation. Best for testing control loops, navigation stacks, and dynamic interactions.
*   **Unity:** A premier game engine. Best for high-fidelity rendering, complex user interactions, and visual AI training.

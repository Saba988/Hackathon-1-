# Capstone Project: The Autonomous Humanoid

This capstone project integrates concepts learned throughout the course to build an autonomous simulated humanoid robot. The goal is to develop a system where the robot can:

1.  **Receive Voice Commands**: Utilize speech-to-text technology (e.g., OpenAI Whisper) to interpret high-level instructions.
2.  **Cognitive Planning**: Employ Large Language Models (LLMs) to translate natural language commands into a sequence of actionable ROS 2 behaviors.
3.  **Path Planning & Navigation**: Plan and execute paths in a complex environment, navigating around obstacles using advanced navigation stacks (e.g., Nav2).
4.  **Object Identification**: Use computer vision techniques (e.g., from NVIDIA Isaac ROS) to identify specific objects in the environment.
5.  **Object Manipulation**: Perform physical interactions with identified objects, demonstrating humanoid manipulation capabilities.

This project will provide a hands-on experience in bringing together perception, planning, and action in a simulated humanoid robotic system.
